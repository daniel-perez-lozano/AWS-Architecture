Due to time constraints, I was unable to write the script. However, below are the steps I would follow to accomplish the requested task:
1. To secure EC2 instances, I would install an **EDR agent** and a **vulnerability management agent**. Given the budget and integration needs, I would choose **CrowdStrike Falcon** as the EDR solution, based on its strong reputation in the **Gartner Magic Quadrant** and my personal experience with its effectiveness.

2. For this scenario, I will assume that all EC2 instances are running **Linux-based images**. The installation process and agent compatibility will be based on this assumption.

3. I would deploy **AWS KMS (Key Management Service)** to securely store any sensitive information or secrets needed for the deployment process, such as authentication tokens or API keys for the security agents.

4. To deploy the agent across all EC2 instances, I would use **AWS Systems Manager** to create a custom **SSM document**. This document will automate the installation process, ensuring that the security agent is installed on all relevant instances without manual intervention.

5. I would write a **Python script** using **Boto3** (the AWS SDK for Python) to automate the deployment process. The script will:
   - Retrieve secrets from **AWS Secrets Manager** for credentials.
   - Use **SSM** to trigger the installation of the EDR agent on all EC2 instances.
   - Include robust error handling to ensure smooth execution and to log any issues.

6. To ensure the deployment is successful, I would create **CloudWatch Alarms** to alert the **security** or **operations team** if the installation fails or if any issues arise during the deployment on the EC2 instances.

7. I would create policies that automatically install the security agent on any new EC2 instances launched in the future. This could be done by integrating the SSM document into the EC2 instance launch process, ensuring that new instances are immediately configured with the agent.

8.  To ensure ongoing security compliance, I would set up **regular checks**  to confirm that all instances have the security agent installed and that it is functioning correctly.
