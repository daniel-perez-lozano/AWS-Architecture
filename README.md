# Project README

## Overview

Due to the nature of my hands-on experience primarily being based on a different cloud provider, coupled with the high workload during the closing of the year, I was unable to fulfill all the requirements for this task within the given time. However, I prioritized what I believed was most important to ensure the core aspects of the project were covered.

## Contents of the Repository

1. **Architecture Diagram**  
   This repository contains the requested architecture diagram, which outlines the design for the platform. In order to keep it clean and focused, I have also included additional requirements that were not showcased directly in the diagram.

2. **Security Requirements**  
   Since not all security requirements could be visually represented in the architecture diagram, I’ve listed these detailed requirements in a separate file called **`security_requirements.md`**. This file contains a comprehensive list of the security protocols and policies that should be implemented for the architecture.

3. **Security Agent Deployment Steps**  
   Although I was unable to write the script due to time constraints, I’ve outlined the steps I would take to deploy the security agent in the **`SecurityAgent.md`** file. The document details the process I would follow, including tools, services, and scripts to use, to ensure the deployment is secure and efficient.

## Conclusion

While the hands-on implementation for the scripts couldn't be fully completed, the provided documentation outlines the necessary steps and architectural considerations that would be followed to successfully complete the task. I hope this serves as a strong foundation for moving forward.
